# Research, Document, Finalize (RDF) Command

**Automate comprehensive research-first implementation workflows**

---

## üìã Overview

The RDF command automates the complete research-to-implementation pipeline that many developers follow manually. It's designed for teams and individuals who value research-backed decisions and comprehensive documentation.

**Command:** `/research-document-finalize` or `/rdf`

**Time saved:** 4-6 hours per feature/upgrade

**Quality level:** Production-ready documentation with cited sources

---

## üéØ What It Does

### Phase 1: Research üìö

**Automatic research using:**
- **Exa AI** - Web search for official docs, articles, benchmarks
- **GitHub API** - Version verification, code examples from verified repos

**Research questions answered:**
1. Are we using the **LATEST versions** of libraries/tools?
2. Are there **BETTER alternatives** to proposed solutions?
3. What are the **2025 BEST PRACTICES** for patterns we're using?
4. What **training data or examples** do we need?

**Source quality standards:**
- ‚úÖ Tier 1: Official documentation (Anthropic, OpenAI, framework maintainers)
- ‚úÖ Tier 2: Verified repositories (1.5k+ stars minimum)
- ‚úÖ Tier 3: Technical standards (RFCs, W3C specifications)
- ‚ùå NO sources below Tier 3

### Phase 2: Documentation üìù

**Auto-generated documentation:**

1. **Research Analysis Documents** (`research/documentation/[topic]/`)
   - Executive summary with key findings
   - Options comparison table
   - Benchmark results (performance, cost, quality)
   - Decision matrix with weighted scoring
   - Final recommendation with rationale
   - All sources cited with URLs

2. **Implementation Guide** (`upgrades/[name]/IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`)
   - Pre-flight verification commands
   - Exact dependency versions from research
   - Phase-by-phase implementation with complete code examples
   - Testing strategies
   - Rollback procedures
   - Links to all research documents

3. **Supporting Files** (`upgrades/[name]/examples/`)
   - Training data (JSON/YAML)
   - Configuration examples
   - Helper scripts
   - Sample queries/inputs

4. **Updated Master Plan** (`upgrades/[name]/IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md`)
   - Latest library versions
   - Technology recommendations
   - Updated code examples
   - Cross-references to research

### Phase 3: Finalization ‚úÖ

**Git automation:**
1. Review all created files for completeness
2. `git add` all documentation
3. `git commit` with descriptive message
4. `git push` to remote
5. Provide completion summary

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
/rdf authentication-system

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

### Software

- **Claude Code** - [Download here](https://claude.ai/code)
- **Git** - For commit/push automation
- **Python 3.9+** (if researching Python projects)

### MCP Servers (Required)

The command uses these MCP servers:

1. **Exa** - For web research
   ```bash
   # Add via Claude Code MCP settings
   claude mcp add exa https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp
   ```

2. **GitHub** - For code search and version verification
   ```bash
   # Add via Claude Code MCP settings
   claude mcp add github npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
   ```

### Project Structure (Optional)

RDF works best with this structure, but can adapt:

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ documentation/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [topic]/           # Research docs go here

2. Identify critical questions that need research:
   - Are we using the LATEST versions of libraries/tools?
   - Are there BETTER alternatives to proposed solutions?
   - Your custom question here...
```

### Change Output Structure

Modify documentation paths in Phase 2:

```markdown
1. **Research Documents** (`research/documentation/[topic]/[analysis-name].md`):
   # Change to your preferred path
```

### Adjust Commit Message Format

Update Phase 3 commit message template:

```markdown
3. **Commit Message Format:**

## üìà Success Metrics

**From real-world usage (Apex Memory System project):**

| Metric | Before RDF | After RDF | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Research time** | 4-6 hours | 30 minutes | 8-12√ó faster |
| **Documentation quality** | Variable | Consistent | 100% complete |
| **Source quality** | Mixed | Tier 1-2 only | Verified |
| **Version accuracy** | Often outdated | Always latest | 100% current |
| **Missing pieces** | Frequent (examples, tests) | None | Complete |
| **Rework needed** | 20-30% | <5% | 4-6√ó less |

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Command not found"

**Check installation:**
```bash
ls ~/.claude/commands/ | grep rdf
```

Should show:
- `research-document-finalize.md`
- `rdf.md`

**Fix:** Re-copy command files to `~/.claude/commands/`

---

### "Exa/GitHub MCP server not available"

**Symptom:** Claude says "I don't have access to Exa" or "GitHub search failed"

**Fix:** Configure MCP servers in Claude Code settings:
```bash
# Exa
claude mcp add exa https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp

# GitHub
claude mcp add github npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
```

---

### "Git operations failed"

**Common causes:**
1. Not in a git repository
2. Uncommitted changes blocking push
3. No write permissions

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify git repo
git status

# Commit any pending changes
git add .
git commit -m "WIP"

# Verify remote
git remote -v
```

---

### Research returns low-quality sources

**Symptom:** Claude finds sources below Tier 3 (blog posts, random repos)

**Fix:** The command explicitly blocks Tier 4+ sources. If you see low-quality:
1. Check that Exa MCP server is properly configured
2. Try more specific research questions
3. Manually guide: "Only use official documentation"

---

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Let It Run Fully

**Don't interrupt the workflow.** RDF is designed to be fully autonomous. Interrupting mid-phase can leave incomplete documentation.

**Best practice:**
```bash
/rdf my-feature
# ‚òï Go get coffee, let it complete
```

### 2. Provide Context in Existing Docs

RDF reads existing documentation. Help it by providing context:

**Good setup:**
```markdown
# IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md

## Problem Statement
We need to upgrade our authentication system...

## Current Implementation
Using JWT tokens with...

## Goals
- Improve security
- Add MFA support
```

**Result:** RDF knows what to research (MFA providers, JWT best practices, etc.)

---

### 3. Review Research Before Implementation

**After RDF completes:**
1. Read the research documents (5-10 minutes)
2. Validate the recommendations
3. Adjust if needed

**Remember:** RDF provides recommendations, but **you** make final decisions.

---

### 4. Use for New Projects Too

**Not just upgrades!** Use RDF for greenfield projects:

```bash
/rdf new-microservice-architecture
```

RDF will research:
- Latest microservices patterns (2025)
- Best frameworks and libraries
- Deployment strategies
- Testing approaches
